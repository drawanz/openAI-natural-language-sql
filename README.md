# OpenAI Natural Language Converter

This is my first project using openAI to convert natural language to SQL queries. Here I use the text completion davinci-002.

## Setup

1. If you donâ€™t have Python installed, [install it from here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone this repository.

3. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd openai-quickstart-python
   ```

4. Create a new virtual environment:

   ```bash
   $ python3 -m venv venv
   $ . venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install the requirements:

   ```bash
   $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Make a copy of the example environment variables file:

   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```

7. Add your [API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the newly created `.env` file.

8. Run the app:

   ```bash
   $ python3 -i app.py
   $ >>> main()
   ```

You should now be able to write in natural language and receive a SQL query.
